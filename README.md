Hacktober-Fest 2020 -> open for all!

Hacktober fest is here

# Cpp-Codes

The repository contains common data structures, algorithms and implementations of the popular problems in C++. The Repository also contains graphic programming codes, contest solutions like of Euler Plus on HackerRank and some Coursera competitive programming course solutions.

1. Sparse Table Algorithms
2. String Algorithms [KMP, Suffix Trees, Suffix Arrays, Rabin Karp, and Manacher]
3. Dynamic Programming
    * State Space Reductions
    * Simple Recursions and Divide and Conquer
      * Dp Over Subsets
      * Bitmasking Dp
      * Digit Dp
      * Dp on Trees
4. Searching Algorithms
      * Binary Search
5. Game Theory
      * Nim Game
6. Queues, Stacks And LinkedList
7. Trees
8. Backtracking Algorithms
9  Exhaustive search problems
10. Graphics Programming
11. Coursera Courses
12. Euler Plus Solutions
13. Graph theory

# Important points to be considered before making a Pull Request:

1. Read the existing codes CAREFULLY. Do not submit any code that is already existing in the repository, else that PR will be marked as spam

2. You are free to submit your codes in any language you want, make a folder for that specific language

3. Provide proper CODE files, not TXT files or files without any extension, to maintain code portability.

4. Try to keep your codes genuine (Not a hard-and-fast rule tbh :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: )

Lastly, do not submit useless PRs. That would be marked as spam straightforwardly.
